    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Have you ever wondered how deliciously crunchy a cockroach might be but was never ever able to fullfill that dream due to unrelenting societal standards?</p>
    <p>Well fear not today for this recipe will help you concoct the most satisfying and crispy sugar-coated candy with the same level, if not more, of crunchiness as a wild cockroach hiding under your home's refrigerator.</p>
    <p>It's very simple to make that even cockroaches could probably be able to if only they were blessed with limbs like us superior human mammals.</p>
    <p>Well what are we waiting for? Let's jump right in!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Any fruit of your liking</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Skewers</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <ol type="I">Prepare the Fruit
            <li>Wash the fruit and completely dry them, otherwise the sugar won't stick.</li>
            <li>Remove any undesirable parts of the fruit diminishing the texture and taste of the fruit, ie. leaves, stems, seeds.</li>
            <li>If necessary, cut your fruit into bite-size pieces.</li>
            <li>Poke your fruit pieces onto the skewers. For best results, limit to 3 pieces per skewer.</li>
        </ol>
        <li></li>
    </ol>
