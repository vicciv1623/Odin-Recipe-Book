    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Have you ever wondered how deliciously crunchy a cockroach might be but was never ever able to fullfill that dream due to unrelenting societal standards?</p>
    <p>Well fear not today for this recipe will help you concoct the most satisfying and crispy sugar-coated candy with the same level, if not more, of crunchiness as a wild cockroach hiding under your home's refrigerator.</p>
    <p>It's very simple to make that even cockroaches could probably be able to if only they were blessed with limbs like us superior human mammals.</p>
    <p>Well what are we waiting for? Let's jump right in!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Any fruit of your liking</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Skewers</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol type="I">
        <li>
            <ol type="i">
                <p>Prepare the Fruit</p>
                <li>Wash the fruit and completely dry them, otherwise the sugar won't stick.</li>
                <li>Remove any undesirable parts of the fruit diminishing the texture and taste of the fruit, ie. leaves, stems, seeds.</li>
                <li>If necessary, cut your fruit into bite-size pieces.</li>
                <li>Poke your fruit pieces onto the skewers. For best results, limit to 3 pieces per skewer.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <ol type="i">
                <p>Make the Sugar Coating</p>
                <li>Add sugar and water in a ratio of 2:1 in a pot.</li>
                <li>Heat up the pot to low to medium heat.</li>
                <li class="asterik">***DO NOT STIR THE POT because the air bubbles causes the sugar to crystalize</li>
                <li>Keep heating up that shit until it <span id="thicc">thicc</span> like some nice old syrup. The color should be giving <span id="amber">amber</span>. </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <ol type="i">
                <p>Test the Sugar Coating</p>
                <li>Before you start pouring that shit onto your delightful fruit cutlery, you gotta test your <span id="sugar-sugar">sugar sugar</span>.</li>
                <li>Do this by drizzling a spoonful of syrup into an ice water bath.</li>
                <li>If the sugar hardens within seconds and shatter when you attempt to exert pressure via what I hope are sanitized fingertips, that when you know it's ready.</li>
                <li>If your sugar syrup fails to pass the test, you gotta let it simmer in the pot a little more dear. Patience is sweet and savory.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <ol type="i">
                <p>Now Some Fun shit</p>
                <li>Simple: Dip your fruit skewers inside your <span id="sugar-sugar">sugar sugar</span> and <span id="swirl">SWIRL</span> that mf around.</li>
                <li>Helpful tip: when you take your fruit skewers out from the pot, twirl it so that the excess sugar don't drip over the side and onto your delicate skin.</li>
                <li>Immediately dunk your sugar coated skewer inside an ice water bath to harden the burning sticky sugar coating to a satisfyingly crunchy one</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Enjoy!</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
